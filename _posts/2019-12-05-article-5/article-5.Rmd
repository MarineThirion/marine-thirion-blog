| Published in ?  | *Nature plants* on the 11/11/19  |
| General topic    | The biggest study of the morning glories which also contributes  to the taxonomy and evolution of this megadiverse group of plants |
| Procedure     | The researchers led the first study of the morning glories at a global scale, they described 63 new species and indentified of a large number of synonyms. They used dried plants preserved and analyze their morphology and their molecules to compare them |
| Conclusion/discovery    | As previously thought, the storage root was an already-existing trait that predisposed the plant for cultivation and not just the result of human domestication/ Sweet potato is not the only species of morning glory that produces storage roots |
| Remaining questions   | Scientists have to do an up-to-date taxonomy to stop the biodiversity crisis. |
