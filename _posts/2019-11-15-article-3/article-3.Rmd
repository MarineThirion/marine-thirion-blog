| General topic    | Scientists previously thought that plants were always in competition but in harsh soil mature plants help young plants to thrive    |
| Procedure     | Scientists study plants in their entire life and not at one moment particularly. They analyzed plants living in harsh environments and they saw that seedlings benefits from litter of the mature plants who make more flowers compared to plants on their own. Because of that, it has a huge good impact on biodiversity    |
| Conclusion/discovery    | A mature and established large plant called a nurse help a younger plant to grow healthily. Scientists called this processed *Facilitation*.It also helps to keep environments and ecosystems healthy |
| Remaining questions   | What are all the benefits of this relationships win-win ?  |
