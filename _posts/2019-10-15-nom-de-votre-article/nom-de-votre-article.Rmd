## Analysis table  

**Researchers :** Martin-Luther-Universität Halle-Wittenberg  
**Published in :** July 15, 2019 in the scientific journal *The plant cell*  
**General topic :** Study on the immune system of plants  
**Procedure :**  
First : Investigation in the defences processes of the thale cress and it’s quite different than we thought
Second : A bacteria found how to overcome the low level immune system of plants
Third : Evolution of plants’ immune system 
Fourth : Want to apply the process on tobacco plant but it’s definitively more complex beacause of another genome
Finaly : Swap the genes of these 2 plants : tobacco plants require a different protein complex than thale cress |
**Conclusion/discovery :** The immune system of plants was not like we thought it was, it’s in fact completely different from one plant to another one. Proteins involved in immunity are a little different from one plant to another one  
**Remaining questions :** What are other immunity proteins in plants more complex ?
