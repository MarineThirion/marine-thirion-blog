**Week 5**  
This week I started to watch a new serie in English with the english subtitles. Sometimes I try to understand without it but that's difficult to me to hear all the words. 
I also watched free scientifics courses on a website called "Khan academy", you can learn a lot of things on a lot of subjetcs.  

**Week 6**
This week I've continued to watch my series on Netflix *BatesMotel* and I have put *The Big Bang Theory* in English and I thought that jokes was really better ; French traduction is sometimes such a mess. I've read biological articles on plants and that was really interesting. I've also watched YouTube videos of American humorist  

**Week 7**
I've started to play videogames on Nintendo Switch like Skyrim and I've put all the game in English. It's a really good game and graphisms are amazing, people who realized it were really talented. I've decided to watch *Stranger things* in English and I've watched American videoes on YouTube. I've also helped my little sister with her homeworks in English, she has 12 years old and so she is learning the basics of this language.
